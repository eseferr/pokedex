-- POKEDEX CLI --
This is a Boot.dev REPL  CLI project

Project Description:
A REPL, or Read-Eval-Print Loop, is a simple interactive programming environment that takes user input, evaluates it, and returns the result to the user. 
In this guided project, you'll build a Pokedex-like REPL in Go that uses the PokeAPI to fetch data about Pokemon. 
's a great way to put your Go knowledge to the test and learn valuable skills like HTTP networking and data serialization.
